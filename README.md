## Welcome to Jayden's AMD PC Budget Build

This is just a little parts list for gamers on a budget of $600 or less. The following parts can be found at this [link] (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vXYGBZ) 

### CPU and GPU Combo

For solid 1080p gaming we will be using the Ryzen 3 3100 and the GTX 1650 Super in our build. The reason I chose these parts as our CPU and GPU combo because they can effectively handle 1080p gaming over 60 fps on medium-high settings.
