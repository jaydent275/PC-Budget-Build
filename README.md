## Welcome to Jayden's AMD PC Budget Build

This is just a little parts list for gamers on a budget of $600 or less. The following parts can be found at this [link.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vXYGBZ) 

### CPU and GPU Combo

For solid 1080p gaming we will be using the Ryzen 3 3100 and the GTX 1650 Super in our build. The reason I chose these parts as our CPU and GPU combo because they can effectively handle 1080p gaming over 60 fps on medium-high settings. 
The Ryzen 3 3100 is a quad-core, 8 threaded CPU, meaning that is very capable of simple everyday tasks and gaming. 
The GTX 1650 Super is for the streamers that are on a budget, as NVIDIA's GPUS come with their NVENC encoder that does the heavy lifting for streaming. However, this is a very able card for gaming or rendering videos. From price to performance, this is the best NVIDIA card on the market as of right now. This is the TUF Gaming option with 4 gigabytes of GDDR6 memory.

### Motherboard

Assuming that you might do a little bit of overclocking on your Ryzen 3 3100, the B450 DS3H MicroATX motherboard is a very good option at $72.99. As a very popular budget motherboard option, it comes with everything you need for a motherboard, 4 DIMM slots, IO shield, and 1 M.2 slot for your NVME SSD. 

### Memory/RAM

RAM, also known as random access memory, which is what your computer uses as short term memory. Think of it as the computer tabs on your Chrome browser. The recommended storage for RAM in 2020 is 16 gigabytes, so I went with a pair of 2x8gb DDR4 RAM sticks from Team Vulcan, their T-Force model. This model in particular has a cas latency (CL) of 16 and can be clocked up to 3200 megahertz. Ryzen CPUs heavily depend on high speed RAM for best performance overrall.

### Storage

For storage, I couldn't fit a dedicated hard drive in the build so we will use the SSD as the boot drive and main storage. This can be used when you first build this PC but later along the upgrade path I highly recommend that you purchase a dedicated storage drive. This M.2 drive is the 500 gigabyte storage option from Western Digital. While not having the fastest write speeds, it does its job loading up Windows and storing your games just fine. 

### Case

No computer can be completed with a case. The Versa H18 from Thermaltake is a very good MicroATX option that comes included with a power supply shroud and 1 pre-installed fan set as exhaust. At a price point of around $54.99, the front panel comes equipped with 1 USB 3.0 port, 2 USB 2.0 ports, and microphone/HD audio ports. This is the very case that I use myself in my own build, and the best part of this case that many other cases do not have are the front mesh, and tempered glass side panel. 

### Power Supply

Last but not least, the power supply. This unit is responsible for delivering power to your motherboard, CPU, GPU, SSD, and other parts that require power. It converts AC electricity from your outlet to low voltage regulated DC power for your internal computer components. This model is the 500 watt 80+ bronze model from EVGA. It is a semi-modular unit, meaning that it has the 24 pin connector permanently attached to it, but allows you to choose the rest of the cables, for your SATA, 6-pin, 8 pin, and other connectors. This model also comes with 2 velcro straps for cable management.
